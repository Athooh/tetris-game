## **How to Play**

### **Objective**
The goal of Tetris is to score as many points as possible by clearing horizontal lines of blocks. You do this by maneuvering falling tetrominoes (shapes made of four blocks) to create complete lines without gaps. When a line is completed, it disappears, and you earn points. The game ends when the stack of blocks reaches the top of the grid.

### **Gameplay**
1. **Tetrominoes**: Different shapes (I, O, T, S, Z, J, L) fall from the top of the grid.
2. **Movement**: Use the arrow keys to move the tetrominoes left, right, and down.
3. **Rotation**: Rotate the tetrominoes to fit them into gaps.
4. **Line Clearing**: Complete horizontal lines to clear them and earn points.
5. **Game Over**: The game ends when the blocks stack up to the top of the grid.

## **Game Features**

- **Smooth Animations**: The game uses `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth and efficient animations.
- **Responsive Design**: The game adapts to different screen sizes and devices.
- **Pause Menu**: Pause the game at any time and resume or restart.
- **Score Tracking**: Your score increases as you clear lines.
- **Timer**: A timer tracks how long you've been playing.
- **Sound Effects**: Enjoy sound effects for moves, rotations, line clears, and game over.

## **Installation**

### **Running the Game Locally**
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/tetris-game.git
   cd tetris-game
   ```
2. **Open the Game**:
   - Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
   - Alternatively, use a local server (e.g., VS Code Live Server or Python's `http.server`).

## **Technical Details**

### **Technologies Used**
- **HTML**: Structure of the game.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout.
- **JavaScript**: Game logic and interactivity.
- **SVG**: Rendering the grid and tetrominoes.

### **Key Components**
1. **Grid**: A 10x20 grid where tetrominoes fall and stack.
2. **Tetrominoes**: Seven shapes (I, O, T, S, Z, J, L) that fall from the top.
3. **Game Loop**: Uses `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth animations.
4. **Collision Detection**: Ensures tetrominoes don't overlap or go out of bounds.
5. **Score System**: Points are awarded for clearing lines.
6. **Timer**: Tracks the elapsed time during gameplay.

## **Performance Optimization**

The game is optimized for performance to ensure smooth gameplay:
- **`requestAnimationFrame`**: Used for rendering to achieve 60 FPS.
- **Cell Caching**: Only updates cells that change, minimizing DOM manipulation.
- **SVG Rendering**: Uses scalable vector graphics for efficient rendering.
- **Sound Preloading**: Sound effects are preloaded to avoid delays during gameplay.

## **Future Improvements**

Here are some ideas for future enhancements:
1. **Lives System**: Add a lives counter to give players multiple chances.
2. **Levels**: Increase the speed of falling tetrominoes as the player progresses.
3. **High Score System**: Save and display the highest scores.
4. **Mobile Support**: Add touch controls for mobile devices.
5. **Themes**: Allow players to choose different color themes.
6. **Multiplayer Mode**: Add a competitive multiplayer mode.
